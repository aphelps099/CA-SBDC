## 1.0

	- Improved exception handling to catch all exceptions and not just those from Google's PHP API.
	- Updated feed creation step to skip OAuth if the current user has already authenticated with Google.
	- Refactored the Google Sheets Object Type (for Populate Anything) to be more performant in both the form editor and on the frontend. As a result of this, the "Row Number" property is deprecated.
	- Fixed issue where failing developer metadata creation requests would cause the add entry job to be retried resulting in the entry being added to the sheet multiple times.
	- Fixed issue where OAuth-ing with Google could result in the (absolutely hilarious) message "Error connecting to Google: Successfully authenticated with Google."

## 1.0-beta-2.10

	- Fixed an issue where Google Sheets Field Mappings would not be editable.

## 1.0-beta-2.9

	- Updated the default HTTP request timeout to Google to be 15 seconds rather than 5 seconds. It is now filtered by `gpgs_http_request_timeout` instead of `http_request_timeout`.

	- Added a spinner to the feed creation flow to indicate when Google authentication or sheet selection is occurring.
	- Improved the feed creation flow by disabling options until they have been populated with the selected sheet's data.

## 1.0-beta-2.6

	- Updated Action Scheduler to 3.6.1.
	- Fixed issues where "Select existing sheet" wouldn't work for users who did not have permission to activate/install plugins.
	- Added new `gpgs_show_action_scheduler_purge` PHP filter hook to show a panel in the GP Google Sheets settings to purge uncomplete actions from Action Scheduler.
	- Improved user experience by blocking "Select existing sheet" if a Gravity Perks license isn't present instead of nothing happening when clicking the radio button
